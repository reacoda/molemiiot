# The Code

The first thing you will need to do is to include all the necessary libraries as follows:

```text
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <Hash.h>
#include <ESPAsyncTCP.h>
#include <ESPAsyncWebServer.h>
#include <OneWire.h>
#include <DallasTemperature.h>
```

Declare the GPIO pin that is connected to the DS18B20 sensor. In our case we are connecting to GPIO 4 \(D1\):

```text
#define ONE_WIRE_BUS 4
```

Instantiate the instances needed to initialize the sensor:

```text
// Setup a oneWire instance to communicate with any OneWire devices
OneWire oneWire(ONE_WIRE_BUS);

// Pass our oneWire reference to Dallas Temperature sensor 
DallasTemperature sensors(&oneWire);
```

Setup your network credentials:

```text
const char* ssid = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD";
```

Create an AsyncWebServer object on port 80:

```text
AsyncWebServer server(80);
```

Using the following, read the temperature:

```text
String readDSTemperatureC() {
  // Call sensors.requestTemperatures() to issue a global temperature and Requests to all devices on the bus
  sensors.requestTemperatures(); 
  float tempC = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);

  if(tempC == -127.00){
    Serial.println("Failed to read from DS18B20 sensor");
    return "--";
  } else {
    Serial.print("Temperature Celsius: ");
    Serial.println(tempC); 
  }
  return String(tempC);
}
```

In case the sensor is not able to get a valid reading, it returns -127. So, we have an if statement that returns two dashes \(â€“-\) in case the sensor fails to get the readings.

```text
if(tempC == -127.00){
  Serial.println("Failed to read from DS18B20 sensor");
  return "--";
```

The reaDSTemperatureF\(\) function works in a similar way but returns the readings in Fahrenheit degrees.

The readings are returned as string type. To convert a float to a string, use the String\(\) function.

```text
return String(tempC);
```

The next step is building the web page. The HTML and CSS needed to build the web page are saved on the index\_html variable.

In the HTML text we have TEMPERATUREC and TEMPERATUREF between **%** signs. This is a placeholder for the temperature values.

This means that this **%TEMPERATUREC%** text is like a variable that will be replaced by the actual temperature value from the sensor. The placeholders on the HTML text should go between **%** signs.
