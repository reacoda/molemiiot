# The Code

The default code when you startup the Arduino IDE looks like this:   


```text
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

Include the code to control the LEDs. Start by defining variables so that we can address the lights by name rather than a number. 

```text
int redLED = 10;
int yellowLED = 9;
int greenLED = 8;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
