# Adding a button to control the LEDs

Now that ****you know the basics, let’s improve it. Add in a pushbutton to control the LEDs whenever you want.  
  
The circuit for the LEDs is exactly the same as the activity above. Connect the button to digital pin 12. You’ll notice that the switch has a high-impedance 10k? resistor attached to it.
