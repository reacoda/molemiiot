# Molemi Personal Food Computer

The Molemi PFC will be used for both educational and research purposes. We want to start a public research and development in hydroponics farming  that will be run by "public scientists". 

This document will serve to give a detailed explanation and tutorials on how to build and run a Molemi PFC.  

The mPFC will allow participants/collaborators/candidates/makers/tinkers to learn hardware and software development skills specifically in laser cutting, fabrication, internet of things, data science and machine learning.
