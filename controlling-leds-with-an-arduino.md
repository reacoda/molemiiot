# Controlling LEDs with an Arduino

### What will you need ?

* An Arduino Uno board 
* 3 X LEDs \(of different colors\)
* male-to-male jumper wires.
* 3 X 100 ohm \(black-brown-black\) resistor.
* Breadboard 
* A computer with the Arduino IDE software.

Connect the anode \(long leg\) of each LED to digital pins eight, nine, and ten \(via the 100 resistors\). Connect the cathodes \(short leg\) to Arduino ground.
