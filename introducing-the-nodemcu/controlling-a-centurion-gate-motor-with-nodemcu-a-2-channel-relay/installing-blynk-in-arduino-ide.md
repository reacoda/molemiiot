# Installing Blynk in Arduino IDE

This activity will show you how to setup the Blynk platform on the Arduino IDE software. There are three ways to do that:

1. **Using built-in library manager in Arduino IDE.**
2. **Installing Blynk library as a zip file in Arduino IDE.**
3. **Manually install Blynk library.**



1. **Use the built-in library manager in Arduino IDE**

To install the Blynk library, open the Arduino IDE and click on the **Sketch &gt; Include Library &gt; Manage Libraries**

Once the library manager opens, search for "blynk" in the search bar and in the version, select the latest one:

Lastly, click on install. This may take a while to download and install. Once it is done you can find the new blynk library by clicking  **Sketch &gt; Include Library** .

2. **Install Blynk as zip file in Arduino**

Download the Blynk library from the following link: [https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/latest](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/latest) 

Once you have downloaded the zip file, don't unzip it. Just leave it as is

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to **Sketch &gt; Include Library &gt; Add .Zip Library**

Once prompted, add the zip file.

Return to the **Sketch &gt; Include Library menu.** menu. You should now see the library at the bottom of the drop-down menu. It is ready to be used in your sketch. The zip file will have been expanded in the libraries folder in your Arduino sketches directory.
