  As part of this activity we show you how to install the DHT library on the
  Arduino IDE. This will be used to allow your DHT11 sensor to communicate with
  your NodeMCM so that you can get the readings.

# Installing DHT library on the ESP8266

 To read from the DHT sensor, we’ll use the [DHT library from Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library). To use this library you also need to install the [Adafruit Unified Sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor). Follow the next steps to install those libraries.

1.  Open your Arduino IDE and go to **Sketch** &gt; **Include Library** &gt; **Manage Libraries**. The Library Manager should open.
2.  Search for “**DHT**” on the Search box and install the DHT library from Adafruit.

 3. After installing the DHT library from Adafruit, type “**Adafruit Unified Sensor**” in the search box. Scroll all the way down to find the library and install it.
