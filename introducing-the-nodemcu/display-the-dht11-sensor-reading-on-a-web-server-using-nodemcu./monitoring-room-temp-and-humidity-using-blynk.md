# Monitoring Room Temp & Humidity using Blynk

### Objectives:

* Setup the circuit with the NodeMCU and the DHT11 sensor.
* Configure/setup the Arduino IDE by installing the DHT11 library.
* Setup the Blynk App on your smartphone to include the display widget for both temperature and humidity.
* Write the code that will read the temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor.

#### Explaining the components

* The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin \(no analog input pins needed\).



### Setting up the circuit:
