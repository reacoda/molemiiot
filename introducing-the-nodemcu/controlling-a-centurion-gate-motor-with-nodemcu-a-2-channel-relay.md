# Controlling a Centurion gate Motor with NodeMCU a 2-channel relay

For this activity we will be controlling the Centurion gate motor with a 2-channel relay. We will be using the Arduino-based nodeMCU and the Blynk mobile app to control the relay. The Blynk app will have two buttons. One will be to open and the other will be to close the gate. 

#### What will you need ?

* NodeMCU dev kit 
* 2-channel relay 
* An android smartphone with the Blynk app installed.
* male-to-female jumper cables
* a desktop computer/laptop with the Arduino IDE installed 

If this is the first time working with the NodeMCU, you will need to install the ESP8266 board on the Arduino IDE as demonstrated here: 

The first thing you will need to do is to add the is include the example code for blynk using the nodeMCU board.
