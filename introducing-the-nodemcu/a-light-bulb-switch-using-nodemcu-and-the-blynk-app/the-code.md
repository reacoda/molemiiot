# The Code

Using a USB power supply cable, connect your nodeMCU to the USB port on your computer.

On the Arduino IDE go to **Tools &gt; Board &gt;** choose the appropriate NodeMCU board i.e NodeMCU 1.0 \(ESP -12E Module\).

Now choose the relevant port by going to Tools &gt; Port &gt; and choose the appropriate port.

Now for the code you need to go to **File &gt; Examples &gt; Blynk &gt;  Boards\_Wifi &gt; NodeMCU** \(select to include code\). The code will look as follows:

  Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control
  Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet.
  You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your
  projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

 *************************************************************
  This example runs directly on NodeMCU.

  Note: This requires ESP8266 support package:
    https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

  Please be sure to select the right NodeMCU module
  in the Tools -> Board menu!

  For advanced settings please follow ESP examples :
   - ESP8266_Standalone_Manual_IP.ino
   - ESP8266_Standalone_SmartConfig.ino
   - ESP8266_Standalone_SSL.ino

  Change WiFi ssid, pass, and Blynk auth token to run :)
  Feel free to apply it to any other example. It's simple!
 *************************************************************/

/* Comment this out to disable prints and save space */
#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial


#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h>

// You should get Auth Token in the Blynk App.
// Go to the Project Settings (nut icon).
char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";

// Your WiFi credentials.
// Set password to "" for open networks.
char ssid[] = "YourNetworkName";
char pass[] = "YourPassword";

void setup()
{
  // Debug console
  Serial.begin(9600);

  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);
  // You can also specify server:
  //Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass, "blynk-cloud.com", 80);
  //Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass, IPAddress(192,168,1,100), 8080);
}

void loop()
{
  Blynk.run();
}

```

Now go to your e-mail inbox and copy your authentication code and paste it char auth. Then add your network credentials were the ssid is the name of the network you are using and pass is its password. 

```text
char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";
// Your WiFi credentials.
// Set password to "" for open networks.
char ssid[] = "YourNetworkName";
char pass[] = "YourPassword";
```
