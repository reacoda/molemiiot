# Setting up Blynk

For this activity we need to setup the Blynk app to communicate with the NodeMCU app to be able to read the water flow sensor. 

The first thing you will need to do is to have the Blynk app installed on your smartphone. For Android users, go to the Google Play Store and search "Blynk". Choose the one written "Blynk-IoT for Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi".

Once installed, setup your own account using your e-mail address.   
  
Create a "New Project" and name it Centurion Gate Motor. Once you are done, add the gauge widget and then label it "Total Liters \(L\)". Assign it a virtual pin of V1 and set it to take/send readings every second.
