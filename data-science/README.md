# Data Science for Farming

The Data Science for farming workshop will follow the IoT for farming workshop. The next challenge for the participants will be to collect, analyse and interpret the sensor data that they have collected using the Molemi food computers.

This activity will help the participants understand the importance of analysing and using data to tell a story particularly in farming.

For this part of the workshop we will be using google colaboratory for doing most of the activities/lessons.
