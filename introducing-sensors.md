  For this activity we will be introducing the TMP 34  temperature sensor. we
  will show how to read sensor data on the serial port and later we will display
  the readings on a small monitor.

# Introducing Sensors

### The TMP34 temperature sensors 

In this part of the session we will be using a simple temperature sensor, the TMP34, to measure the ambient room temperature. The sensor readings will be displayed on the serial port.

#### What will you need ?

* Arduino Uno Board
* 3 X male-to-male jumper wires 
* Breadboard 
* TMP34 temperature sensor 
* A computer with an Arduino IDE software
