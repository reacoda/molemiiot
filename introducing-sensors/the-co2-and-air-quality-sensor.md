# The CO2 and air quality sensor

### Objectives:

* The aim of this activity is to measure the amount of CO2 in the environment and measure the air quality based on the ambient temperature.
* Connect the circuit for the CCS811 sensor.
* Write the code \(and upload on the Arduino Uno board\) to serial print the CO2, ambient temperature and volatile organic compounds.
