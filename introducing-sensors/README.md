  For this activity we will be introducing the TMP 34  temperature sensor. we
  will show how to read sensor data on the serial port and later we will display
  the readings on a small monitor.

# Introducing Sensors

### The TMP36 temperature sensors 

In this part of the session we will be using a simple temperature sensor, the TMP36, to measure the ambient room temperature. The sensor readings will be displayed on the serial port.

#### What will you need ?

* Arduino Uno Board
* 3 X male-to-male jumper wires 
* Breadboard 
* TMP36 temperature sensor 
* A computer with an Arduino IDE software 

#### What to do ?

Wire up your breadboard so you have power and ground. Connect the ground and power to the TMP36 sensor. Use the third jumper cable to connect the signal lead of the TMP36 sensor to the A0 analog pin on the arduino board as shown below:
