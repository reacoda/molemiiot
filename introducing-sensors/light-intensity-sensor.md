# Light Intensity Sensor

BH1750FVI digital light intensity module is a digital light intensity sensor integrated circuit used for two-wire serial bus interface. It uses the light intensity data collected by module to adjust the brightness of LCD and keyboard backlight. The module resolution can detect a wide range of light intensity changes.

### Objectives:

* Setup the circuit to allow the Arduino Uno to communicate with the BH1750FVI sensor.
* Setup the Arduino IDE to be able to upload the code to the Arduino IDE.
* Write the code to be able to serial print the light intensity readings.

#### Setup the Circuit:
