# Introduction to Arduino Programming

One of the micro-controllers that will be used for the the Sustainable Farming Methods workshop will be the Arduino board. We will be using two variations namely the Arduino Uno and the NodeMCU.  
  
The Uno will be used for introducing the basic concepts and programming methods while the NodeMCU will be used to connect the sensors to the internet.  
  
We will be using the Arduino board as it is open-source and affordable.
