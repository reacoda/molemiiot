# Introduction to Arduino

One of the micro-controllers that will be used for the the Sustainable Farming Methods workshop will be the Arduino board. We will be using two variations namely the Arduino Uno and the NodeMCU.  
  
The Uno will be used for introducing the basic concepts and programming methods while the NodeMCU will be used to connect the sensors for the IoT section of the workshop.  
  
We will be using the Arduino board as it is open-source and affordable.

#### What is an Arduino ?

An Arduino board is an open-source micro-controller that is used to read inputs - temperature and humidity on a sensor, pressing/toggling a button and it is able to give out outputs - turning a motor and switching on an LED \(read [full introduction here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)\).

### Getting Started

In order to start using the board, one needs to setup the Arduino IDE on their desktop by using the [getting started user guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
